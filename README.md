### Tuts+ Course: Up and Running with Foundation for Apps
#### Instructor: [Kezz Bracey](https://tutsplus.com/authors/kezz-bracey)

In this course you'll learn all the essentials of working with Zurb's "Foundation for Apps" framework, and how to create a complete interface for a Task Management web app. Discover how to use the web design skills you already have to start designing application UIs.


#### Source Files
In this package you'll find all the code seen in the demonstrations throughout the course.

In the "App Development Files" folder you'll find all the HTML and Sass files created. To reproduce the app in full you can, after completing Foundation for Apps installation and the generation of a new app project, copy and paste in the full "client" folder then rebuild the app with the `foundation-apps watch` command described in the course.

Also included is the folder "Final App Build" which is the finished version of the app seen tested in a second localhost server at the end of the course.

**Available on Tuts+ 28 May, 2014**
